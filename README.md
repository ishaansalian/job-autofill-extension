This extension helps you quickly fill out job application forms by saving your personal information (like name, email, phone, LinkedIn, etc.) and experiences (such as job titles, companies, and dates). Once saved, you can easily copy this data and paste it into any relevant fields on job sites. The extension also allows you to see what you've saved and customize your info for different sections, making the application process faster and more efficient.
